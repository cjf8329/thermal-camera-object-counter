Fixed rate: $__ to create a script to detect, count, and classify object by shape and temperature at distances of 0.3 to 1 meter and <100 degrees celsius. Must run solely on a raspberry pi using a MLX90640 IR camera, and (if applicable) a GSM module in order to make updates to a google sheet tracking the detected objects.
